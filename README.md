# Codemonk-ML-Assignment
Deep Learning model to classify fashion products by color, type, season, gender.

# Fashion Product Classification

## Project Description
This project is part of the Codemonk ML Internship Assignment. The goal is to classify fashion products based on:
- Color
- Product Type
- Season
- Gender

I built a deep learning model using PyTorch and did detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## Files in this repo
- `fashion_classification.ipynb`: Complete notebook with code, EDA, model training and testing.
- `model.pth`: Trained model weights.
- `encoders.pkl`: Label encoders for inverse transforming the predictions.

## ðŸ”— Model Weights
Since the model `.pth` file is large (>25MB), you can download it from here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/12hw_a2gFlnIP1Vb7toKjXJpO3I6zApAc/view?usp=drive_link

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle GPU environment

## How to run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Load the `model.pth` and `encoders.pkl`.
3. Run predictions on new fashion product images.

## Bonus
- Amazon product images were taken and used for prediction evaluation.
